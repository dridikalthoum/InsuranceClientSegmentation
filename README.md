# 🏦 Insurance Client Segmentation Project 🏦

This project is part of an **internship** focused on using **Data Science** techniques to analyze and segment insurance clients based on a variety of features. By leveraging **unsupervised learning** models, we aim to gain meaningful insights and improve business strategies by identifying distinct client groups based on their insurance profiles. This project takes into account **personal data** (e.g., Date of Birth, Gender, Name) and **insurance details** (e.g., Premiums, Contract Type, Duration) to cluster different clients effectively.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to segment clients into **distinct groups** based on their insurance and personal data. This segmentation helps the firm identify patterns in customer behavior, allowing for more targeted marketing, policy offerings, and client management.

## 🗝️ **Key Objectives**
- 📂 **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare customer data, which includes personal and insurance information.
- 🧪 **Unsupervised Learning**: Implement **K-Means** clustering to group clients based on relevant features.
- 🔢 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the feature space and improve clustering performance.
- 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Apply **Elbow Method** and **Davies-Bouldin Index** to determine optimal cluster count and measure model performance.
- 📈 **Visualization**: Provide visual representations of client segments to interpret the results.

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Tools**
This project employs the following **Machine Learning** libraries and techniques for clustering:

- ⚙️ **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation.
  - `Scikit-learn` for unsupervised learning algorithms.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.

- 🔍 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **K-Means Clustering** for client segmentation.
  - **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.
  
- 🛠️ **Clustering Techniques**:
  - **Elbow Method**: To determine the optimal number of clusters by analyzing inertia.
  - **Davies-Bouldin Index**: To measure the quality of clustering and separation between clusters.
  - **Inertia**: To evaluate how well the clusters fit the data points.

## 📏 **Evaluation Metrics**
To measure the performance of the clustering algorithm, we use the following evaluation metrics:

- ✨ **Elbow Method**: Analyze the **inertia** as a function of cluster count, identifying the "elbow point" where adding more clusters offers diminishing returns.
- 🏆 **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Evaluate the **compactness** and **separation** of clusters for quality assessment.
- 📉 **Inertia**: Measure how tightly clustered the points are within each cluster.

## 🗂️ **Data Overview**
The **customer dataset** used in this project includes:

- 📅 **Personal Information**: Date of Birth, Gender, Name, Address, Occupation
- 🛡️ **Insurance Information**: Policy Number, Premiums, Contract Type, Contract Duration, Severity, Product, Lifetime Value

## 🖼️ **Visualizations**
Visualizing the **clustered data** allows us to interpret the client segments effectively:

- **PCA plots**: Reduced feature space for visualizing clusters in 2D.
- **Cluster Heatmaps**: Illustrate the distribution of clients across different clusters.
- **Elbow Plot**: Shows the **inertia** for different numbers of clusters to determine the optimal count.

## 🚀 **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, normalize relevant features, and prepare the dataset.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Apply **Standardization** to scale features for better clustering performance.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use **PCA** to reduce the feature space while preserving key variance.
4. **Clustering**: Implement **K-Means** with various cluster numbers and evaluate performance using the **Elbow Method** and **Davies-Bouldin Index**.
5. **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize and interpret the clusters.

## 🏆 **Results & Insights**
- 📊 Segmentation revealed distinct groups based on **premium size**, **contract type**, and **contract duration**.
- 🏅 **Optimal Number of Clusters**: The **Elbow Method** indicated that 3 to 4 clusters provided the best segmentation.
- 🔍 **Cluster Analysis**: Each cluster highlighted clients with similar insurance preferences, allowing the firm to develop more targeted strategies.

## 🏫 **Academic Context**
This project is part of a **Data Science internship** at an **insurance firm**, aligning with the academic pursuit of applying **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to **real-world problems**.
